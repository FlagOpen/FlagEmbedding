<h1> BGE-Reasoner: Towards End-to-End Reasoning-Intensive Information Retrieval </h1>
</div>

## Introduction

We introduce **BGE-Reasoner**, an end-to-end reasoning-intensive information retrieval framework. BGE-Reasoner is characterized by three key features:

1. **End-to-end**: It comprises three core components in IRâ€”**BGE-Reasoner-Rewriter**, **BGE-Reasoner-Embed**, and **BGE-Reasoner-Reranker**â€”covering the entire retrieval pipeline, from query rewriting and retrieval to reranking for reasoning-intensive tasks.
2. **Excellent performance**: **BGE-Reasoner** achieves **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** performance on [BRIGHT](https://brightbenchmark.github.io/), a reasoning-intensive information retrieval benchmark, with an **nDCG@10 of 43.8** across 12 datasets, outperforming the previous SOTA by +2.2 points (41.6 from [DIVER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07995), Aug 12, 2025).
3. **Open-source resources**: We will release the code, model checkpoints, training data, and evaluation scripts to facilitate future research on reasoning-intensive information retrieval. Please stay tuned!

## Performance

**BGE-Reasoner** achieves SOTA performance on the **BRIGHT** benchmark with the following pipeline:

1. **Query Rewrite**: **BGE-Reasoner-Rewriter** rewrites the original query to a more reasoning-friendly form.
2. **Retrieval**: **BGE-Reasoner-Embed** and **BM25** each retrieve the top-2000 documents from the corpus using the rewritten query. Hybrid retrieval combines the results from both methods, with a weight of 0.75 for BGE-Reasoner-Embed and 0.25 for BM25 (after min-max normalization).
3. **Reranking**: **BGE-Reasoner-Reranker** reranks the top-100 documents from the previous step. Hybrid retrieval combines the reranked results with those from the previous step, assigning a weight of 0.5 to each method.

Our work is still in progress. We temporarily report the preview-version results of **BGE-Reasoner** on the **BRIGHT** benchmark as shown below. Detailed results for each component, along with additional technical details, will be released soon.
