Jo says: ""a rotation of \( 90^{\degree} \) anticlockwise""

Paul says: ""a rotation of \( +270^{\degree} \) about \( (-1,1)^{\prime \prime} \)

Who is correct? ![A coordinate grid with two trapeziums drawn on it and a centre of rotation marked on, one space to the right and one space up from the origin. Trapezium P has the coordinates: (-4,4) (-2,4) (-2,3) and (-4,1). Trapezium Q has the coordinates: (-4,-2) (-4,0) (-3,0) and (-1,-2).]()","Only
